                Sarah Hontoy-Major focuses their research on our data; how we collect and use them, but more so how they shape the objects we consume. As an undergraduate in Computation Arts at Concordia University (Montreal), Sarah works to entertwine skills developed in previous fashion design and political science degrees in various technological and artistic approaches. Former research assistant at Vestechpro, an apparel research and innovation center, she is now a research assistant for Ying Gao (École Supérieur de Mode de Montréal, UQAM) and UQAM's Chaire Diament, research cluster on design for cyber mental health, as part of the Visuallys project.

                        Data and algorithms are a part of all spheres of our lives, whether we like it or not. For
                        instance, AI art has been on the rise for many years, though its legitimacy has been increasingly
                        questioned (Chambers 2020, Roose 2022). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the
                        technology responsible for a lot of visually artistic demonstrations of AI, produces un-real
                        images created from real pictures. At a higher level, algorithms are used by commercial entities
to generate new products and information for its clientele to consume. Giant retailers like Shein
have implemented powerful algorithms generating trend and design patterns and using them for
real-time production decisions. With a never-before-seen turnaround time for creating and
producing fashion, Shein is reinventing how quickly we consume what was already the fastest
ever fashion industry (Oliver 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Byung-Chul Han, a Korean-bord German philosopher and cultural theorist, is the co-
author of non-Things, an essay that examines how the humanity interacts with data and its

resulting material objects (Han and Steuer 2022). According to him, everything existing as a
result of information, or data, is a non-thing, as opposed to real things worked from human hands
and intent (Han and Steuer 2022). He expands on the idea of machines, pointing out that we use
them to make human lives easier; machines are our new workers so the human can become "not
a worker but a player" (Han and Steuer 2022, 9). Through the dynamics he observes in his book,
machines and their non-things are antagonized as apparatuses lacking human virtue such as
pathos, passion, or even "the conceptual level of knowledge" (Han and Steuer 2022, 40, 42). We
must however remember the intent with which they were built. We judge machines with the
same standards we judge humans, having only taught them how to be workers. Medium is the

message; if machines do not have pathos, it may be because it was left out by design (McLuhan
1967).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artists have however been emerging and reimagining the power dynamics of working
with AIs. Creatives like Sougwen Chung and Ben Snell, respectively painter and sculptor,

approach their practice and AI as a collaboration that questions the hierarchy of humans and non-
humans (Sougwen, Snell 2018). Chung paints along side machines taught on her own

movements and “investigates the interactions between mark-made-by-hand and the mark- made-
by-machine as an approach to understanding the dynamics of humans and systems” (Sougwen).

Snell, on the other end, tasked an AI, taught on a vast database of classic sculptures, to complete
a unique sculpture; in it he found not only a finished piece, but also "traces of the computer’s
invisible processing power [...] containing its thoughts and memories"(2018). Snell sees his
finished product as a "materiality upon the impossibly immaterial" made from “the raw material
of computation"(2018), as opposed to Han, who would describe the sculpture as a non-thing
made from immaterial information (Han and Steuer 2022).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from artists, companies like Chronogenica, a montreal-based co-op helping find
older machines a new job and life while making both humans and machines equal members of its
entity, also exemplifies how humans can rethink their relationship and hierarchical position
towards non-humans (Chronogenica).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though already explored by several artists and commercial entities, the power dynamic
of human with machine and their collaborative working relationships in creating objects of
consumption, especially clothes, remain scarcely researched.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this context, how can a collaborative methodology of garment creation with AI can be
developed, which questions the power and creative dynamic of humans and machines?

                    Data Patterns is a project and research on how digitally generated and collected data impact consumerist objects, especially within clothing and fashion. While researching on this topic, I found myself reminiscing paper trails of pre-computer artisanship. Indeed, we are rapidly losing traces of analog history which have not been translated into our modern world. Genevieve, my ever-moving grandmother, lost all her fashion designs, papers and patterns through her life. By creating a community-based corpus of digitalized paper sewing patterns, I wish to construct a tool allowing ‘material’ media to impact our modern tools, such as AI, in a permanent fashion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stuck in the battle between copy rights infringements and critical analysis of creativity itself, many fail to conceive of AI or ‘AI art’ as one of the artist’s many tools. Commercial and artistically geared AI systems access almost uncontrollable amounts of data which the individual user has no power on. Moreover, these systems lack large amounts of data created before the digital age, namely those of artists and artisans. By creating a community-based corpus of historical sewing patterns, my goal is not only to prototype with a more controlled pool of data but also to ensure artisanship’s legacy in the digital age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While trying to conceive of new ways humans and machines could work together, I came to explore technologies such as Dall-e, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. My goal was to generate shapes that looked like sewing patterns and interpretate them into wearable clothing pieces. Although the research was conclusive in finding some methodologies for artisanship and AI to collaborate, the fact I had no control on the data I was fetching from meant I had little control on what I could receive. Instead of the anticipated technical 2D sewing patterns, all I received were silhouettes of already worn clothes. Creating a very specific corpus of sewing patterns will therefore allow more accurate results in the next stages of the research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While creating a better tool for research, this project also aims to ensure that analog data of artists and artisans, especially patternmakers and seamstresses, are transferred to the digital realm. Both my grandmother’s lost paper-trails of her designer’s past and my best friend’s grandmother’s old sewing patterns’ collection she’s given me were my inspiration for this project. However, my hope is to gather more collections of personal and commercial analog patterns coming from all times and spaces. The resources of this grant will be used to find and collect those historical paper pattern collections and digitalize them using specialized equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research prompted the creation of this sewing patterns corpus which it will become a valuable tool for. However, it will hopefully live on to also become an open source and community-based space where one can share and find once analog patterns free of rights.

                    Let you = a_land aims at facilitating its users' visualization, interpretation and knowledge of the lands on which they stand, as well as the interconnectedness between them based on their own situatedness. The main interface is composed of three layers, two of them using API keys from both Google Maps and Native-land Digital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are using the internet in 2023, API keys are all around you everyday. They provide access to some of the world's largest databases and apps, and hence tonnes of terabytes of raw knowledge. Applications like Google, Spotify, New York Times and even NASA each use API keys to make their data available to anyone* wanting access to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence, the first layer of this project's interface was built using the Google Maps API, making the user able to navigate on the most used Mercator projection map on the internet.This layer was greyed out, because as much as it is necessary for the user to realistically situated themself geographically, it was not the intention to put the main focus on this layer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second layer was made with Native-land Digital API, which gives free public access to virtually all the data on their own website. While recreating Indigenous territorial maps on top of Google Maps API, they aim at creating and fostering "conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources such as [their] map". Their map is in continuous development and does not claim to be an official source of knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The third layer is how the user is called to interact with the interface. The path that traces back users to users in chronological order of log in was meant to create an intertwined thread of some kind, a sort of second-skin weaved fabric placed on top of our lands, connecting our own situatedness with that of other users of the interface.

                    <p>As part of our last semester in Fashion Design, we were asked to realize an eco-friendly concept in link with a chosen artistic direction. My main interest layed in the garments’ life cycles eco-direction. Because I have had the chance to work in the development of sustainable fabric and garment production chains for Vestechpro, an innovative apparel research center, I had already acquired knowledge to help me further the project in a way that was as creative as it was realistic.</p>
                    <p>After a thorough research about all steps needed to produce a garment, from the farming or synthesis of its raw materials to its release during its end-of-life, the conclusion was simple: all steps hold an unimaginable weight on the environment and have a devastating impact on our planet’s biodiversity and durability.</p>
                    <p class = "boldParagraph">I then put myself to the challenge of creating a manifest garment that would modify or eradicate all harmful steps from the production cycle of a conventional garment.</p>
                    <p>Raw materials were replaced by domestically compostable wood pulp instead of recyclable, reusable, or upcyclable materials that still use an important amount of plastic and release synthetic nanoparticles in the environment and especially our oceans). Local beauty was portrayed by Quebec’s flora in the concept dress, however, could have been dressed in vegetal diversity from other territories, so long as the dress keeps its goal to represent a local art piece.</p>
                    <p>To reduce to a maximum the release of end-of-life waste from elements used to create the dress, it was essential for me to let the flora live within the creation itself et not cut it to recreate a form of ephemeral bouquet. It was then important to think of a realistic way to wear… a flowerpot.</p>

                    <p>Dans le cadre de notre dernier semestre de formation en design de mode, il nous a été demandé de réaliser un concept éco-responsable en lien avec une direction choisie. Mon intérêt principal se trouvait dans ‘l’éco-direction’ relatant au cycle de vie des vêtements. Puisque j’ai eu la chance de travaillé pour le développement d’une chaine d’approvisionnement et de production de matières et vêtements éco-responsables pour Vestechpro, un centre de recherche en innovation vestimentaire, j’avais des acquis de bases pour me permettre d’approfondir ce projet d’une façon autant créative que réaliste.</p>
                <p>Après une recherche en lien avec toutes les étapes de production d’un vêtement, de l’agriculture ou la synthétisation de ses matières premières au rejet lors de sa fin de vie utile, le constat était simple : toutes ses étapes ont un poids inimaginable sur l’environnement et un impact dévastateur sur la biodiversité et la durabilité de notre planète.</p>
                <p class="boldParagraph">Je me suis donc mise au défi de créer un vêtement manifeste qui modifiait ou éradiquait toutes les étapes nuisibles du cycle de production d’un vêtement conventionnel.</p>
               <p>Les matières premières ont été remplacées par des matières non pas recyclables, réutilisables ou surcyclables (upcycled) (qui consomment néanmoins du plastique et rejettent des nanoparticules synthétiques dans l’environnement et surtout les océans), mais par des matières compostables de façon domestique (pâtes de bois). La beauté du local fût interprétée par la flora du québec dans la robe concept, mais pourrait aussi bien être revêtue par la diversité végétale d’autres territoires, pour autant que la robe retienne son but de demeurer une œuvre locale.</p>
                <p>Pour réduire au maximum le rejet des déchets et la fin de vie utile des éléments utilisés pour créer la robe, il était primordial pour moi de laisser vivre la flora à-même la création et non pas de les couper pour en faire une sorte de ‘bouquet’ éphémère. Il était donc important de penser à une façon réaliste de porter… un pot-de-fleur.</p>
