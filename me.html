        <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
        <p>
          As a tangible and digital practitioner, I develop creative tools and
          methodologies in various collaborative spaces. I explore the
          middle-ground between my passion for chaos (theory) and that of
          pattern making methodologies (e.g., garments, maps, taxonomy, creative
          coding) through Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The audience
          (sometimes machine) takes control of the structures I build, allowing
          the output to reflect farther horizons than my own interpretation of
          the design. Collaboration can have chaotic tendencies; learning to
          lose control and create in that space is at the core of my practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learn to acknowledge my disposition and how it can best be used
          in amplifying voices. I focus my attention on folk ontologies; that is
          how people think things to be like as opposed to how they really are.
          I design interactive experiences that aim to simplify complex notions
          of our modern world and make knowledge more accessible. I find that
          candid interpretations of convoluted concepts allow more enchanting
          speculations to emerge. I aim for the tools I create to be structures
          not only operable by myself, but by other practitioners as well.

        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <p>
          Sarah Hontoy-Major is a transdisciplinary digital and tangible
          practioner based in tiohtià:ke/Montreal. They ¸ interweave their
          pattern making knowledge and their coding practice in their art-based
          research on creative toolmaking. They have a Political Science degree
          (2017) from Dawson College, a Fashion design degree (2020) from
          Marie-Victorin College, and have been pursuing an undergraduate
          specialization in Computation Arts in Concordia University since 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah has worked as a 3D technician in the fashion industry as well as
          a Research Assistant in several wearable and design labs, namely
          Vestechpro, the UQAM Diament Research Chair in e-Mental Health, and
          for Fashion Designer Ying Gao. They have more recently joined the
          IFRC, AbTeC and Abundant Intelligences research programs exploring and
          developing Indigenous epistemologies and futurism in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their Femme (2022) piece was presented in the Design and Computation
          Arts Flux exhibition in 2022, and their Data Patterns (2022) project
          in the following year’s Strata exhibition. Their Shein’s Cabinet
          (2022) Google Extension was part of the _scapes mediation in
          Concordia’s 4th Space, where the weeklong Fine Arts in.site symposium
          they co-organized also took place. They became the president of the
          Computation Arts Student Society in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Sarah combines their interest for unconventional
          digital-to-tangible creative tool-making and knowledge dissemination
          for non-expert audiences, they are currently working on Symphenia, an
          interactive emulation of the neuroscience of perceptions, set to be
          presented at the Glen Atrium of the McGill Health Research Institute
          in April 2024.
